# Noisy

A jQuery plugin that adds random noise to the background of an element.

## Dependency

-   [jQuery](https://github.com/jquery/jquery)

## Install

Just download the repository and link to the local minimized script:

````html
<script src="noisy/jquery/jquery.noisy.min.js"></script>
````

Alternatively, include it from [cdnjs.com](http://cdnjs.com):

````html
<script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/noisy/1.2/jquery.noisy.min.js"></script>
````

## Usage

An example showing all parameters would be the following:

````javascript
$('body').noisy({
    intensity: 0.9,
    size: 200,
    opacity: 0.08,
    fallback: 'fallback.png',
    monochrome: false
});
````

But since all parameters are optional you can just use it like this:

````javascript
$('body').noisy();
````

You can also set a particles color with color option like this:
````javascript
$('body').noisy({
    intensity: 0.9,
    size: 200,
    opacity: 0.08,
    fallback: 'fallback.png',
    randomColors: false, // true by default
    color: '#000000'
});
````
This works, for now, just with the jquery version.

## Rationale

What's wrong with using an image?

1.  Bandwidth cost  
    Due to the random nature of background images with a noisy overlay,
    compression usually isn't very effective. With this 1 KB script you can
    generate images up to 300 KB without loading for even a second. Saving
    bandwidth costs and loading time.
2.  Development speed  
    Trying out an image with a different noise opacity involves a much smaller
    amount of steps by just updating a parameter than changing and saving the
    image in Photoshop.
3.  Flexibility  
    By generating the background image in javascript, one does not need to rely
    on the webserver being able to serve static files for it. With generated
    favicons etc. a static files serving webserver becomes optional.
